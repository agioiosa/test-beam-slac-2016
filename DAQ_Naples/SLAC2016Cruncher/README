Based on framework powered by Kim Siang Khaw (UW) (https://github.com/kimsiang/SLAC2016) and classes of Stefano Mastroianni thanks also to Anna Driutti

To use this standalone C++/ROOT cruncher framework created for SLAC 2016, simply git clone the whole repository:

git clone https://github.com/agioiosa/test-beam-slac-2016

Then go to the SLAC2016Cruncher/ folder and execute the following command:

make clean; make

Insert the root file (currently frascutirun_00254_analysis.root) that you want to start into the input.script file and crunching the file by running

./crunch input.script

Variables that can be accessed from the root file are defined in EventCollection.h. You can add your crunching codes to the file SLAC2016Cruncher.C and SLAC2016Cruncher.h.
